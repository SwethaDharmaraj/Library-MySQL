# 📚 Library Information System

A simple and efficient Library Information System built using **Flask** (Python) for the backend, **HTML/CSS** for the frontend, and **MySQL** for data storage. This system allows users to add, borrow, return, and view books from a digital library database.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Flask) – for handling server-side logic.
- **MySQL** – for storing library records (books, borrow/return data).
- **HTML/CSS** – for designing the user interface.
- **PHP** – used in `db_config.php` for database connection (legacy support or PHP-to-MySQL bridge).
- **VS Code** – for development.
